 #Credits: At first I knew about that type of projects from my college friend named 'Diptanu'.
 He told me that our college senior named 'Sami Banerjee' doing a project on desktop assistant inspired by Ironman Movies. 
 Then I went to the senior for help,he helped me to setup pyaudio & suggest me to check out codewithharry youtube channel for more details.
 After that there was some issue for webbrowser,because I was using Opera browser,that moment my college friend named 'Pratyush' helped me tor solve the problem.
 So with these people's help I'm able to successfully try that type of projects.
